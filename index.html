        The development of digital technology has brought profound changes to the economy of discourse: the renewal of
        old forms, the emergence of new writing modalities, an inflation of written works and potential creators.
        However, the situation is somewhat unique when it comes to mourning discourses. It has been observed that
        funeral rituals are resistant to change, as one of the interests of ritual is to bring order to the chaos
        generated by death. By definition, a ritual is routine, structured, fixed, and codified. It is the adherence to
        this sequence of stereotyped actions that guarantees its efficacy. This raises questions about the impact of
        sociotechnical transformations on mourning discourses, which, due to their specificity, are less permeable to
        change. Various articles in this dossier address these issues in different ways. <br>
        Firstly, it has been observed that one of the main elements that underpin funeral rituals lies in their
        distinctive spatial and temporal anchoring. Traditionally, the memory of the deceased is primarily maintained in
        a dedicated physical place. Think of cemeteries, war memorials, cenotaphs, mausoleums, or Japanese temples
        designed to honor ancestors. Funeral ritual invests certain places (whether the resting places of the deceased
        or not) in a privileged manner. Moreover, the inscriptions adorning these monuments almost systematically employ
        spatial deictics, emphasizing the importance of these locations. For instance, the "here lies a hero" on
        commemorative plaques or the "here lies" on tombstones turn the place into a medium that brings the deceased and
        the person paying respects into co-presence. Thus, spatial anchoring ensures the effectiveness of commemoration.
        The same applies to temporal anchoring. Funeral ritual is marked by precise time coding, with regular
        appointments that mark the temporality of mourning and allow for individual or collective commemorative
        moments.<br>
        This strong spatial and temporal anchoring of mourning raises questions about the consequences of the emergence
        of new forms of digital funeral rituals. The "dematerialization" of discourses characteristic of the digital
        realm risks abandoning the distinctive spatiotemporal anchoring of mourning discourses. One of the peculiarities
        of online mourning discourses is the severance of the link between commemoration and the physical place of that
        commemoration. In all the cases presented in this dossier (and others), an internet page (whether a Facebook
        wall, a digital memorial, a thread on a discussion forum, etc.) serves as a symbolic gathering place without the
        physical co-presence of all those participating in the commemoration. This is an unprecedented situation as it
        profoundly alters the communicative context of mourning discourses. While communication previously predominantly
        occurred "live" and in person, it now becomes temporally delayed and spatially distant.<br>
        The emergence of these new online mourning modalities has several consequences for the nature of funeral ritual
        itself. Firstly, the number of people involved significantly increases. It is easier (both practically and
        likely emotionally) to connect to a website than to travel to a funeral. Additionally, the non-verbal component
        diminishes when discourse is written rather than spoken. Gestures, facial expressions, and intonation disappear
        when discourse is written, while the role of visual imagery grows. Furthermore, the "dematerialization" of
        discourse leads to a form of generalized mourning. Previously, mourning was reserved for close relatives of the
        deceased, but now it extends to people who traditionally would not have been affected. The internet has
        witnessed a multiplication of mourning discourses directed towards famous but unknown individuals, or at least
        those who were not personally known during their lifetime. Moreover, mourning is now shared with individuals
        encountered randomly during internet browsing, which is an entirely new phenomenon. As such, the appearance of
        mourning discourses on the internet is not straightforward. It cannot be a mere transposition of pre-existing
        funeral rituals,<br>
